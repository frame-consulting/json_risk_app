# **Reports**  
In the integrated reporting tool of the JSON risk app, results of the pricing applet can be analyzed, i.e. results can be displayed aggregated as well as exported as csv file or copied to the clipboard for further use. The applet can be opened via the main menu or directly via the price applet after successful calculations , see [documentation of JSON risk app pricing](/docs/Pricing.md). When opening the report applet via the pricing applet, the result data of the calculation can be evaluated directly in the report applet without saving any data. Otherwise, result data must be available on the backend in order to analyze them.
